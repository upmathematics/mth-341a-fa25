target="_blank">One-to-One, Buckley Center 279 or in Teams</a>
<br><em>Click on the link to sign-up for a 15-minute session.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My walk-in help hours start week 2. Note that you can bring a fellow
student with you when you sign-up for a session. Just click the “Add
Guests” link when you sign-up, and add in your fellow student’s UP
email. If you need more than 15 minutes, you can book at least two
consecutive sessions.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-learning-commons" class="section level3">
<h3>The Learning Commons<span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span></h3>
<p>Students may receive academic assistance through Learning Commons
tutoring services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program
provides students with opportunities to work with other students to get
help in writing, math, group projects, and many other courses. Schedule
an appointment to meet with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the Learning
Commons website (<a href="www.up.edu/learningcommons"
target="_blank">www.up.edu/learningcommons</a>). Students can also meet
with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours. Check the Learning Commons website
or stop by the Learning Commons in BC 163 to learn more about their
services. Co-Pilots are a wonderful support along your academic
journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="math-resource-center" class="section level3">
<h3>Math Resource Center</h3>
<p>Appointment-based tutoring accepts appointments starting week 1 and
sessions start week 2. Visit the <a
href="https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/tutoring-services/math-resource-center/index.html"
target="_blank">Math Resource Center</a> website to sign-up for an
appointment. Drop-in tutoring is Monday to Thursday, 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM
in BC 163 and starts week 2. Check the Math Resource Center website or
drop by the center for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures, class
activities, discussions, homework, and other engagements. I also expect
you to make use of opportunities to get help outside of class (help
hours, Teams, email, tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific
messages are the most helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are encouraged to participate in discussions with your peers
regarding assignments. However, each student must take responsibility
and ownership of their work and submit their work individually, except
for group projects.</p>

<div id="standards-based-grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Standards-Based Grading</h3>
<p>Learning ODEs demands focus, rigorous examination of the concepts you
have encountered, and a process of ongoing refinement and improvement.
You will be assessed on your proficiency in solving a variety of ODEs,
both graphically and analytically, using different methods. You will
have opportunities to demonstrate your proficiency, revise your work,
and reflect on your growth in identifying the type of ODE, determining
appropriate solution methods, and analyzing the behavior of the
solutions.</p>
<p>This course uses a standards-based grading system, which emphasizes
mastery of specific learning objectives. This approach is more precise
and motivating than traditional grading methods and fosters a more
equitable learning environment. Key features of standards-based grading
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear focus on mastering defined learning objectives</li>
<li>The use of diverse assessment methods to evaluate understanding</li>
<li>Regular, detailed feedback to guide your progress</li>
<li>Support in setting meaningful goals and tracking your growth</li>

<li><strong>Follow the Academic Integrity Policy:</strong> Ensure all
work is your own or properly credited where collaboration or external
resources are involved.</li>
<li><strong>Comply with the Course AI Policy:</strong> Any use of AI
tools must align with the course-specific AI guidelines provided. Misuse
of AI will be considered a violation of academic integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Adhere to Referencing and Citation Guidelines:</strong>
Properly cite all external sources used in your work to give appropriate
credit and avoid plagiarism.</li>
<li><strong>Uphold the Academic Honor Code:</strong> I trust you to
maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity in your
work.</li>
<li><strong>Take Ownership of Your Work:</strong> You must contribute
meaningfully and be prepared to explain and defend your work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code of Academic Integrity<span
class="math inline">\(^*\)</span></h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of
learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and
engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such
pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present
truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that
they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s
assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without
proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.</p>
<p>Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical
responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or
other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit
assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are
original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines
for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the
specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also
maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank_">https://libguides.up.edu/cite</a>.</p>
<p>The misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated
as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or
cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI
Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider
appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their
courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not
detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All
members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating
sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work,
upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-ai-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Course AI Policy</h3>
<p>The use of generative AI —such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT— is
encouraged and allowed in all of its capacity. However, students must
use these tools ethically and responsibly. To use generative AI
responsibly in this class, students should grasp underlying concepts,
acknowledge AI’s assistance, protect data privacy, verify information,
and uphold academic honor code. AI should be seen as a learning aid, not
a replacement for critical thinking.</p>
</div>
<div id="ethics-of-information" class="section level3">
<h3>Ethics of Information<span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span></h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information,
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at <a

<div id="other-expectations" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Other Expectations</strong></h2>
<div id="deadline-extensions" class="section level3">
<h3>Deadline Extensions</h3>
<p>If you need more time to submit an assignment, you may request an
extension by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with me at least 12 hours before the deadline.</li>
<li>Specify the exact day you plan to submit your work or the number of
extra days you need.</li>
<li>Please ensure that you adhere to the established timeline for
submitting assignments, as it is important to maintain fairness and
avoid over-reliance on extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submitting a few hours late is usually not a major issue, as long as
I receive your work before I begin marking and providing feedback. An
extension is not required in such cases. Extensions for in-class
assignments –such as worksheets or activities– will only be granted if I
decide to extend the deadline for the entire class.</p>
</div>
<div id="late-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time –such
as a medical reason– are understandable. Please let me know if you have
missed the deadline way beyond its original posted date without prior
communication regarding extensions. Because every assignment is an
important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when
you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable
consequence for your turning it in late. I am committed to successfully
helping you learn from this course.</p>
</div>
<div id="withdrawal-procedures" class="section level3">
<h3>Withdrawal Procedures</h3>
<p>It is the student’s responsibility to drop the course if he or she is
no longer planning on attending the course or filling the other course
requirements. In order to drop, the student must use and Add/Drop form
available at the Registration Office. If a student does not properly
withdraw from a course, he or she may receive an <strong>F</strong> for
the course. A properly withdrawn student will receive a
<strong>W</strong>. The last day to withdraw is <strong>Monday, November
24th</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="appointment-cancellations" class="section level3">
<h3>Appointment Cancellations</h3>
<p>Please try to show-up to your scheduled appointments. You can cancel
your appointments, but it is strongly recommended that you cancel 24
hours before your scheduled time so that other students can schedule
when a spot opens. You can reschedule for a different day and time if
you need to. If you have extenuating circumstances, please let me know
as soon as possible to discuss next steps.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance-and-participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>Attendance is not tracked. However, participation is highly
recommended and often tracked through assignments and general behavior.
You are expected to actively participate in this class. Participation
includes coming to class on time, being prepared, being willing to ask
questions and share ideas, setting up study groups outside of class,
attending tutoring and help hour sessions, posting helpful resources
online, and contributing to the discussion channels. Group and
individual presentation of ideas is a suggested component of
participation.</p>
</div>
<div id="absences" class="section level3">
<h3>Absences</h3>
<p>Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions
according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell should
not attend class in person. These students should inform their
instructor as soon as possible. Should the instructor need to miss
class, the course may be temporarily conducted remotely. Should the
instructor be unable to teach for an extended period of time, the
respective department or unit will find a substitute to continue the
course.</p>
</div>
<div id="incompletes" class="section level3">
<h3>Incompletes</h3>
<p>An incomplete “I” will only be considered when the quality of a
student’s work is satisfactory (C- or better), but for some essential
reason the course has not been completed by the student. An “I” is
reserved for emergency situations only. To request an incomplete, the
student must submit a typed, signed and dated letter stating the
reason(s) why an incomplete is appropriate. The letter should also
contain the conditions for the completion of work. Acceptance of the
request shall be at the discretion of the instructor, Department Chair,
and/or Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement<span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span></h3>
<p>The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). <strong>If you have an AES Accommodation
Plan</strong>, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to
implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for
exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two
weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in
advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your
instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to
ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other
emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or
accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for
completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation
standards specified in the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="mental-health-statement" class="section level3">
